# Image-Classifier-Udacity-Project-with-a-98-Accuracy-Rate-
This project is to develop an Image Classifier with Deep Learning. It can achieve a 98% accuracy rate. 

# AI Programming with Python Project
Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.
